🧠 Project Overview

Our project focuses on visualising key insights from our selected dataset using interactive and meaningful data visualisation techniques. The main goal is to communicate data-driven patterns and relationships through well-designed charts, filters, and user interactions.

✅ Progress Update
1. Data Preparation (Using KNIME)

We used KNIME Analytics Platform to clean, filter, and prepare our datasets before visualisation.

Steps completed:

Imported raw CSV datasets into KNIME.

Used Row Filter and Missing Value nodes to remove incomplete or duplicate data.

Filtered the dataset by year, category, and region to focus on relevant insights.

Merged related tables to combine data for easier analysis.

Exported cleaned datasets into separate CSV files for different chart types.

Output Files:

BarChart_DataSet.csv – Cleaned and filtered for yearly comparison.

PieChart_DataSet.csv – Focused on category distribution.

LineChart_DataSet.csv – Contains continuous time-series data.

These files are ready to be loaded into our visualisation platform.

2. Visualisation Design (Draft)

We have designed draft layouts for our main charts:

Bar Chart – Shows comparison across regions or categories.

Pie Chart – Displays distribution of test results or product types.

Line Chart – Visualises changes or trends over time.

Each chart design includes clear legends, consistent colour palettes, and tooltip interaction ideas.

3. Interaction Design (Draft)

Planned interactions for our web visualisation include:

Hover tooltips for data value display.

Dropdown filters to select year or region.

Buttons to switch between different chart views.

Responsive design layout for both desktop and mobile.

4. Website Design (Draft)

We are developing the website prototype using:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structure and interactivity.

Chart.js and D3.js for visualisations.

Consistent colour theme and navigation bar for a clean layout.

We have completed about 50% of the page structure, and chart placeholders are already set up for integration.

🚧 Blockers & Challenges

Some inconsistencies found in dataset format (had to manually fix column names).

Difficulty connecting multiple chart datasets dynamically in D3.js.

Need to fine-tune CSS responsiveness for mobile view.

🪜 Next Steps

Connect final cleaned CSVs to the chart components.

Implement dropdown filters and tooltip interactivity.

Finalise visual styling and responsive layout.

Upload 50% completed website to Mercury and continue development for final submission.

Record and upload the 6-minute progress video.

🏁 Summary

At this stage, our team has:

Completed data cleaning and filtering using KNIME,

Designed draft visualisations and website structure,

Identified blockers and planned next steps.

We are on track to achieve our 50% completion milestone and continue improving visual design, interactivity, and data integration.
